# color-extractor
A program used to extract the top "HEX color codes" from any image.

the image you want to check is noted in line 14 in the .py code and can be changed. 
at the end we will get a pie chart with the top 5 colors (counted by pixals and noted as HEX codes) in the image.
by changing the number in line 21 we can get more or less of the colors in the image.

requirements: install the following python libraries: Pandas, extcolors, Matplotlib.pyplot, PIL(pillow).

*note the code contains images which are attached as separate files, they need to be saved in the same directory as the .py file
